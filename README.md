# Hospital Inpatient Discharge Analysis

## 📌Project OverView

This project analyzes inpatient discharge records to understand how medical conditions, procedures, demographics, insurance patterns, and county characteristics shape real hospital utilization. The dataset captures a wide range of clinical events, allowing the analysis to map which diagnoses dominate specific age groups, and which Procedures carry severe illness levels that drive higher medical resource use. Each finding is connected to biological, clinical, or social explanations.
The investigation focuses on identifying consistent clinical signals within the data and examining why they appear. Age-specific patterns, gender-linked procedures, severity clusters, obstetric-related encounters, chronic disease trends, and behavioral health cases are interpreted through established medical, social, and epidemiological reasoning. Insurance type and county structure are also evaluated to understand how coverage and population distribution influence hospital activity and total charges.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, providing a comprehensive collection of inpatient discharge records suitable for clinical and demographic analysis.

## Problem Statement

- What diagnosis is most prevalent among patients within the selected age group?
- What is the most common Diagnosis and its association with APR Illness Severity?
- What is the distribution of admission type and how are they associated with Emergency Department Indicator
- What is the distribution of APR (All Patient Refined) Risk of Mortality across different racial groups?
- Which patient race is most associated with Extreme APR Risk of Mortality, what percentage of their admissions are classified as emergency visits, and how does this relate to their average length of stay?
- Which ten counties account for the highest total hospital charges?
- Compare total charges by payment source to identify which payer types generate the most billing volume which is above avg

## Tools

The following tools were utilized to collect, manage, analyze, and visualize hospital data, enabling a comprehensive exploration of clinical and demographic patterns as well as healthcare utilization trends:
- MySQL : Employed for Storaging, cleaning, exploring and manipulation of large scale Hospital Inpatient Discharges Dataset. Enambling accurate indept insight connected to biological, clinical, and social explanations.
- Power BI : Employed to create interactive visualizations and dashboards, allowing clear exploration of hospitalization patterns, trends, and cost distribution across different age groups, prodecures, Diagnonsis and counties.
