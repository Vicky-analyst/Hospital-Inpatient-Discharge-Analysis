# Hospital-Inpatient-Discharge-Analysis
This project analyzes inpatient discharge records to understand how medical diagnoses, procedures, age, gender, insurance type, and county factors shape hospital admissions and total charges. The purpose of the analysis is to find the reasons behind these patterns.  Each finding is connected to biological, clinical, or social explanations.
